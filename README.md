# Challenge

Use the latest version of Angular (no additional frameworks/libraries) and TypeScript to render an arbitrary deeply nested object, for example:

```javascript
{
    a: true,
    b: 1,
    c: 'Hello, World!',
    d: {
        e: 'I am a nested string!',
        f: {
            g: {
                h: {
                    i: 'So am I!',
                    j: false,
                    k: 123,
                    l: 'And I am last!'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Use three types of inputs to display the values: check boxes for booleans, input type numbers for numbers and text boxes for strings.

Additional: try to style the UI as best as you can (again, no additional frameworks/libraries, however you can use a preprocessor, like for example
SCSS).
